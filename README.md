# math300calculator
Gets your category averages and overall average in the class with the available scores

Everything is based off this part of the syllabus

"Grades: There will be 3 in class exams (50 minutes) and a 2-hour final exam (Monday, May 12, 10:30-
12:30). The hour exams will each count for 15% of your final grade, the final exam 25%, the chapter
assignments 20%, and the daily homeworks 10%. A total score of above 90% will guarantee an A"

With the weighting adjusted to account for the fact that the final isn't in 

----------------------------------------------------
- Added to github on 4/6 to try to avoid it getting flagged as a virus. 

- Updated 4/5 to fix an issue where the window would close itself before displaying total score

- None of this factors in any curving he does (if he does it) and only uses raw scores. I've been testing it on my stuff and it gives the right average

- PLEEEASE let me know if you notice any issues and I will fix them. 

- I don't see anything you put in. This is very bare bones and doesn't even handle typos/invalid inputs. May improve that eventually

- Made in c++ and will gladly share the code if you want to see it
